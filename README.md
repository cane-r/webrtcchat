Random(not random really)video call system built with Node.js&WebRtc


Example deployment here : https://webrtcchat-redhatappv2.rhcloud.com

Open the page in two browser tab to see(In firefox two tabs cannot share the webcam I suppose)

Http version is not working as getUserMedia function is not permitted on non secure origins.
